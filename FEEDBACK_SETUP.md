# 📧 Feedback System Setup

Your app now has a feedback system! Here's how to set it up:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create a Feedback Email Address
Create a dedicated Gmail account for feedback:
- **Suggested**: `whogotwho.feedback@gmail.com`
- **Or use your existing email**

### 2. Update the Email Address
In `src/components/FeedbackButton.tsx`, change line 38:
```javascript
window.location.href = `mailto:your-email@example.com?subject=${subject}&body=${body}`;
```
Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email.

### 3. Test It Out
- Visit your app
- Click the green "💬 Feedback" button (bottom right)
- Fill out the form and submit
- It will open the user's email client with pre-filled content

## 📨 How It Works

**For Users:**
1. Click "💬 Feedback" button
2. Fill out form (name/email optional)
3. Choose type: Bug, Suggestion, Feature Request, etc.
